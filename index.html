                Elon Musk co-founded and leads Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and The Boring Company.

                As the co-founder and CEO of Tesla, Elon leads all product design, engineering and global manufacturing
                of the company's electric vehicles, battery products and solar energy products.
                Since the company’s inception in 2003, Tesla’s mission has been to accelerate the world’s transition to
                sustainable energy. The first Tesla product, the Roadster sports car, debuted in 2008, followed by the
                Model S sedan, which was introduced in 2012, and the Model X SUV, which launched in 2015. Model S
                received Consumer Reports’ Best Overall Car and has been named the Ultimate Car of the Year by Motor
                Trend, while Model X was the first SUV ever to earn 5-star safety ratings in every category and
                sub-category in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s tests. In 2017, Tesla began
                deliveries of Model 3, a mass-market electric vehicle with more than 320 miles of range, and unveiled
                Tesla Semi, which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based on fuel costs
                alone. In 2019, Tesla unveiled Cybertruck, which will have better utility than a traditional truck and
                more performance than a sports car, as well as the Model Y compact SUV, which began customer deliveries
                in early 2020.
